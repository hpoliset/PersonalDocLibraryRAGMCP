# Indexing Monitoring Report
## Date: 2025-08-21

### Current Status (02:22 AM)
- **Progress**: 6/85 documents (7.1%)
- **Success**: 0 documents
- **Failed**: 2 documents
- **Parallel Workers**: 5
- **Estimated Completion**: ~25 minutes at current rate

### Failed Documents
1. **Osho Books (39883p).pdf**
   - Error: Timeout after 5415s (90.25 minutes)
   - Issue: Thread not properly terminated, continued as zombie process
   - Actual completion time: ~104 minutes
   
2. **Vrads-dedication.jpg.pdf**
   - Error: No content extracted from PDF
   - Attempted cleaning but still failed

### Documents Currently Processing
- **1992-08-14-Vrads_Sande-Preceptors-L&D01-E.docx**
  - Pages: 39,883 (same as Osho PDF!)
  - Current: Page 39,405 (98.8% complete)
  - Started: 02:19:24
  - Status: Near completion

### Observations
1. **Zombie Process Issue**: The Osho PDF continued extracting for 104 minutes despite timing out at 20 minutes
2. **Large Documents**: Multiple documents with 39,883 pages - possible data issue or actual large compilations
3. **Progress Tracking**: The progress tracking is working but extension mechanism failed to prevent timeout

### Monitoring Active
- ✅ General indexing monitor
- ✅ Failed document tracker
- ✅ EPUB-specific monitor for file descriptor issues
- ✅ Long processing time tracker (>15 minutes)

### Issues to Fix (After Current Run)
1. **Critical**: Replace threading with multiprocessing for proper process termination
2. **Critical**: Fix extension mechanism - grant extensions as long as progress seen every 5 minutes
3. **Important**: Implement 50% CPU/memory resource limits
4. **Important**: Fix EPUB file descriptor exhaustion
5. **Enhancement**: Dynamic worker scaling based on hardware

### Performance Metrics
- **Processing Rate**: ~3 documents/minute (for normal-sized docs)
- **Large Document Rate**: ~400 pages/minute
- **CPU Usage**: ~37% (room for optimization)
- **Memory Usage**: ~1.4GB for large document processing
